# NASA SAR Data Visualization App

A Flutter application for visualizing and analyzing Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data from NASA satellites, built for the NASA Space Apps Challenge.

## Features

### 🚀 Core Functionality
- **Explore Tab**: Browse study areas with categorized SAR datasets (Disasters, Climate, Urban, Natural Features)
- **Analyze Tab**: Interactive SAR data viewer with layer controls, measurement tools, and analysis capabilities
- **Compare Tab**: Side-by-side comparison of temporal datasets with multiple viewing modes (overlay, swipe, difference)
- **Discover Tab**: Educational content about SAR technology and Earth observation
- **Profile Tab**: User settings, saved analyses, and account management

### 🎨 Design Features
- Modern NASA-themed dark design with space gradients
- Material 3 design principles
- NASA blue accent color (#0B3D91)
- Responsive layout with proper spacing and elevation
- Subtle animations and transitions

### 📱 Technical Features
- Flutter Material 3 theming
- Custom reusable widgets
- Mock data for demonstration
- Interactive visualizations
- Bottom navigation with 5 tabs
- Floating action buttons for key actions

## Screenshots
